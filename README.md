# Regional Geop Synthesis Group Project

This is a group project for CERI 7244/ 8244 Regional Geop Synthesis class by Prof Powell. Our goal is to utilize the group effort and share our code based on Chunyu's original one for ours and anyone's future reference.

The folder "process_data" includes a matlab code "process_data.m" which is used to do all the processing. 

The folder "plot" includes a macro " plot_cen_maggrav" written by Christine Powell and Modified by myself. 

One can do detrend, upward continuation, reduce to pole, vertical derivative, and horizontal derivative.
