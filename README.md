**Regional Geop Synthesis Group Project**

> This is a group project for CERI 7244/ 8244 Regional Geop Synthesis class by Prof Powell.
> Our goal is to utilize the group effort and share our code based on Chunyu's original one for ours and anyone's future reference.

Chunyu's remarks
* The folder `process_data` includes a matlab code `process_data.m` which is used to do all the processing. 
* The folder `plot` includes a macro `plot_cen_maggrav` written by Christine Powell and Modified by myself. 
  - One can do detrend, upward continuation, reduce to pole, vertical derivative, and horizontal derivative.
